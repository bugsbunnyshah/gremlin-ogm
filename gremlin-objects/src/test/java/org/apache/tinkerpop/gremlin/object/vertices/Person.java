/**
 * The {@link Person} class represents the "person" vertex. Its label has been overridden to be
 * "person", based on its class-level {@link Alias} annotation.
 *
 * <p>
 * It has a {@link #name} property which we'll assume uniquely identifies it in the "person" vertex,
 * and hence is annotated with {@link PrimaryKey}. It has a required {@link #age} property, by which
 * persons are assumed to be ordered, in the graph system, and hence a candidate for a {@link
 * GraphTraversal#order()} by clause.
 *
 * <p>
 * Whereas both of the above properties are primitive, the {@link #titles} property is a
 * multi-property, and furthermore a set as opposed to a list. Similarly, the {@link #locations}
 * property is a multi-property, only it's a list, *and* it has meta-properties of it's own. To
 * represent the value of the location property, as well as it's meta-properties, a {@link Location}
 * class is defined.
 *
 * <p>
 * Finally, the person vertex defines a sub-traversal, which tells us how to go from this person to
 * the other people that it knows. Other person-related traversal logic may be co-located here.
